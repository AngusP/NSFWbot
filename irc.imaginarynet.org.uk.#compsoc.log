"2013-10-22 13:14:22","angusp","Anyone seen the Intel Galileo? Looks like a pretty cool RasPi competitor"
"2013-10-22 13:26:50","Jammy","angusp: Looks pretty cool, although what's the advantage of it over a different Arduino?"
"2013-10-22 13:27:08","Jammy","Obviously it's x86, but what does that actually get you?"
"2013-10-22 13:30:53","Fib","Speedz"
"2013-10-22 13:30:56","Fib","MegaHurtz"
"2013-10-22 13:38:21","angusp","Jammy: It runs linux, using Intel's architecture calles idk what, but they're trying to compete with ARM. The power is in being able to use Arduino IO functions in the same piece of code as linux system calls and stuff, so basically it's c++ and Linux as opposed to Pyton and Linux (mainly) on a RPi"
"2013-10-22 13:38:28","angusp","plus it looks cool"
"2013-10-22 13:38:48","Jammy","oh!"
"2013-10-22 13:38:55","Jammy","I didn't realise it actually ran Linux"
"2013-10-22 13:39:35","Jammy","I kinda flicked through the page about it on the Arduino website and got the impression it was just a standard arduino with a 400MHz Pentium processor"
"2013-10-22 13:42:13","angusp","I'm pretty sure it runs linux; seen references to calling linux functions in ino code. Having a pentium on an arduino would be as overkill as a powerpc in a stannah stairlift"
"2013-10-22 13:44:04","angusp","Oh wait - there is a powerpc in a stannah stairlift"
"2013-10-22 13:45:26","Jammy","we have to wait until the end of November before we can get one?"
"2013-10-22 13:45:27","Jammy","aww man"
"2013-10-22 13:46:10","angusp","Jammy: hey said someting about giving them to unis for cheap/ free. Really want one next to my Pi so they can have a flame war over elinux architechtures"
"2013-10-22 13:46:32","angusp","IMHO the arduino pin layout is a win for me"
"2013-10-22 13:47:24","Jammy","that won't mean you get one :P"
"2013-10-22 13:48:00","Jammy","it means they'll sit in a cupboard and be used as part of a course"
"2013-10-22 13:48:30","Jammy","also, Edinburgh only just switched to Freescale Tower boards for embedded systems, so I can't see them changing to this any time soon"
"2013-10-22 13:48:46","angusp","bollocks."
"2013-10-22 13:50:19","angusp","Actually, I take that back. Just looked up the freescale tower board and it's pcb porn"
"2013-10-22 13:51:05","Jammy","they are pretty cool"
"2013-10-22 13:51:49","Jammy","although they're loaded with kernels without the timer included"
"2013-10-22 13:52:03","angusp","so disappointed /r/pcbporn doesn't exist. I'll have to stick to /r/cableporn"
"2013-10-22 13:52:10","Jammy","I asked the TA if I could rebuild the kernel with the timer included, and he said to just put a sleep in instead"
"2013-10-22 13:52:10","angusp","Jammy: Dat's dumb"

"2013-10-22 15:34:25","hamhut","yeah, who needs an X server"
"2013-10-22 15:35:29","hamhut","angusp: I'm considering moving to ubuntu, just so I can use steam 'properly' :p maybe the graphics drivers will work better in the Ubuntuverse"
"2013-10-22 15:37:32","hamhut","angusp: I installed xubuntu on my netbook and had about 30 mins trying to figure out why my X server wasn't starting and why I couldn't just startx :p"
"2013-10-22 15:38:15","angusp","mmmmm... still fall back on ope source drivers if it's nvidia"
"2013-10-22 15:38:54","angusp","often startx doesn't work in *buntu, you need sudo lightdm or sudo gdm, something like that as it's weird"
"2013-10-22 15:39:31","@amazoph","lol, X. I've gone through several attempts of trying to update the graphics driver on my nettop, I think it has some frankenstein combination of Debian-packaged Nvidia drivers and the direct from Nvidia version."
"2013-10-22 15:39:49","@amazoph","thinking that nuking from orbit and starting over may be the only way to clean this mess"
"2013-10-22 15:40:14","@amazoph","fortunanely i don't use the graphical enviroment that much on it..."
"2013-10-22 15:41:00","@amazoph","tl;dr: open source driver good, 3rd party packaged one bad."
"2013-10-22 15:43:19","hamhut","amazoph: yeah os drivers work really well on my laptops... but rendering a flash video is about as far as I get before my computer decides it's had enough and stops"
"2013-10-22 15:43:59","hamhut","amazorph: I use the os drivers because the prop. ones crash my computer... and I'm too lazy to figure it out"
"2013-10-22 15:44:51","@amazoph","haha, yeah. there's just so much that can go wrong, I got fed up of trying to fix it every time it updated"
"2013-10-22 15:45:26","@amazoph","hopefully with the advent of the steambox things will get better in the future"

"2013-10-22 15:51:58","Fib","Also the steam controller is bad!!"
"2013-10-22 15:54:38","hamhut","Fib: yeah, then it will need a general package manager for security patches and such... Will it maintain its own flavour of linux? I suppose people will create repos for it though"
"2013-10-22 15:54:54","hamhut","if it's open source, then cool things can happen"
"2013-10-22 15:55:20","@amazoph","it's already been said that steamos will be modifiable by the user"

"2013-10-22 17:33:36","Jammy","I always like asking this"
"2013-10-22 17:33:42","Jammy","the answer is usually just "it's different""

"2013-10-22 17:36:32","Jammy","and I have to scroll again"
"2013-10-22 17:36:32","angusp","hamhut: Yep."

"2013-10-22 17:37:08","angusp","hamhut: Win8 doesn't /need/ secure boot but comes with it by default to pissoff dual booters"

"2013-10-22 17:38:52","hamhut","the metro thing, don't you kinda need (easier to use) the scrollwheel? also it scrolls sideways!!"
"2013-10-22 17:38:59","hamhut","with the down scroll"
"2013-10-22 17:39:05","angusp","WIn8 is still noticeably slower than a tidy linux install on the same machine"

"2013-10-22 17:42:30","hamhut","Jammy: okay, I can live with that... are they trying to move to a more central config area for the whole computer?"
"2013-10-22 17:42:54","Jammy","well, they're trying to standardise how to get to it"
"2013-10-22 17:43:11","Jammy","it's not like on iOS Windows Phone where you go to settings and you have settings for all of your apps"
"2013-10-22 17:43:40","Jammy","but, whichever app you're in (if it's "modern" UI), you open the charm bar, click settings, and the settings are there"
"2013-10-22 17:43:56","hamhut","Jammy: that would be nice. do you know if they are trying to get devs to use a global settings area? or is that the reg?"
"2013-10-22 17:44:06","hamhut","does windows still have that?"
"2013-10-22 17:44:29","Jammy","registry is still there, but I imagine it isn't used in "modern" apps"
"2013-10-22 17:44:41","Jammy","I haven't dont much W8 development, so I'm not sure"
"2013-10-22 17:44:57","Jammy","WP8 keeps settings in a database thing within the app sandbox"
"2013-10-22 17:45:22","angusp","Love the subliminal meaning of "I haven't don't much Win8 dev...""
"2013-10-22 17:46:09","hamhut","okay, that's pretty cool. so they're trying tot make things easier for devs... but they'll still use their own config files (I'm thinking games here)"
"2013-10-22 17:46:16","hamhut","s/tot/to"
"2013-10-22 17:46:24","StrawHatter","angusp, go try out for year rep for CompSoc so hamhut has some competition"
"2013-10-22 17:46:49","hamhut","StrawHatter: what!! I have competition! just look!"
"2013-10-22 17:46:57","hamhut","there are at least 2 other people"
"2013-10-22 17:47:00","angusp","StrwaHatter: Nice try"
"2013-10-22 17:47:04","StrawHatter","not serious competition though <3"
"2013-10-22 17:47:45","hamhut","what? I'm sure they stand a chance!"
"2013-10-22 17:47:59","StrawHatter","hamhut, you're far too modest dear."
"2013-10-22 17:48:02","hamhut","also, they'll have some beautifully prepared statement for friday"
"2013-10-22 17:48:13","hamhut","I'm planning on winging it!"
"2013-10-22 17:48:16","angusp","the final competition to see who will be year rep will be as follows:"
"2013-10-22 17:48:20","hamhut","but at least I have a plan"
"2013-10-22 17:48:39","angusp","type a tar command to extract a tar.bz2 first try, no man-ing"
"2013-10-22 17:48:42","StrawHatter","say you go on irc. you should pretty much just auto win"
"2013-10-22 17:49:04","Jammy","angusp: just extract?"
"2013-10-22 17:49:11","Jammy","are we preserving permissions or not?"
"2013-10-22 17:49:20","hamhut","tar -xzvf aouth.bz2"
"2013-10-22 17:49:23","hamhut","is that close?"
"2013-10-22 17:49:24","Jammy","would you like to see the filenames fly past as they get extracted"
"2013-10-22 17:49:31","Jammy","hamhut: I think change the z for a j"
"2013-10-22 17:49:39","Jammy","IIRC"
"2013-10-22 17:49:41","angusp","hamhut: Jammy wins. Sorry."
"2013-10-22 17:49:49","hamhut","Jammy: damn, it's an impossible task"
"2013-10-22 17:50:02","hamhut","did you man?"
"2013-10-22 17:50:06","hamhut",":p"
"2013-10-22 17:50:39","angusp","hamhut: no one can man that fast... unless you're an amazing grepper"
"2013-10-22 17:50:59","Jammy","tar is pretty easy to learn"
"2013-10-22 17:51:20","Jammy","the j option you're less likely to remember though"
"2013-10-22 17:51:33","Jammy","because who ever uses .bz2"
"2013-10-22 17:51:37","hamhut","yeah, -xvf normally just works"
"2013-10-22 17:51:42","hamhut","(tm)"
"2013-10-22 17:51:53","angusp","Jammy: easy for the common types, a bit harder for the stupid ones like bz2"
"2013-10-22 17:52:12","hamhut","I think I've used bz2 maybe once..."
"2013-10-22 17:52:38","angusp","tar -xvfz does a tar.gz. I think it is j for a bz2"
"2013-10-22 17:53:13","StrawHatter","you guys done the CL tutorial work?"
"2013-10-22 17:53:14","hamhut","yeah, but tar normally autoresolves what algorithm to use"
"2013-10-22 17:53:16","Jammy","my standard options are -xzpf"
"2013-10-22 17:53:36","Jammy","extract a gzip file while preserving permissions"
"2013-10-22 17:53:58","angusp","can tar do .rar? That's possibly the worst one to come across"
"2013-10-22 17:54:06","hamhut","-p is a good one... I should start using that one... tbh my most untarred is my PKGBUILDS, permissions aren't too important"
"2013-10-22 17:54:21","hamhut","angusp: naa, theres unrar for that"
"2013-10-22 17:54:31","angusp","hamhut: not standard"
"2013-10-22 17:54:32","Jammy","sometimes, it the tar contains lots of files, I like to chuck a v in there too"
"2013-10-22 17:54:40","Jammy","so the filenames all fly past and I look like a hacker"
"2013-10-22 17:54:44","Jammy","hax hax hax"
"2013-10-22 17:55:15","hamhut","definitely the way to do it!, what if someone is looking over your shoulder?"
"2013-10-22 17:55:16","angusp","Jammy: I oftern verbose stuff so it looks like I'm actually doing something"
"2013-10-22 17:56:06","hamhut","is anyone going to this thing outside bar 50 at some point tonight?"
"2013-10-22 17:56:19","angusp","hamhut: what thing?"
"2013-10-22 17:56:32","Jammy","oooh, I might"
"2013-10-22 17:56:35","Jammy","although I might be late"
"2013-10-22 17:56:54","angusp","StrawHatter: Ish. Just went through it, wasn't too bad"
"2013-10-22 17:57:30","hamhut","angusp: people are celebrating the success of our test yesterday! also it's compsoc social night"
"2013-10-22 17:57:41","StrawHatter","angusp, it looks super boring"
"2013-10-22 17:57:53","angusp","hamhut: May go, but I'm not drinking for a week."
"2013-10-22 17:57:58","hamhut","I can't be there too long! I need to write an essay"
"2013-10-22 17:58:34","Jammy","who knows what a fibre channel is?"
"2013-10-22 17:58:37","Jammy","are they interesting?"
"2013-10-22 17:58:41","hamhut","it kinda sucks but somehow I've managed to line-up several social events in a row... also."
"2013-10-22 17:58:58","hamhut","is that one of the x channels that runs on a single fibre line?"
"2013-10-22 17:59:04","hamhut","i think 40"
"2013-10-22 17:59:13","StrawHatter","oh yeah"
"2013-10-22 17:59:20","StrawHatter","guess who's getting councelling session sorted <3"
"2013-10-22 17:59:24","angusp","Jammy: Interesting, yes, and flipping fast"
"2013-10-22 17:59:45","hamhut","Jammy: could actually do research... was laying fibre cables in Nairobi... it was pretty awesome"
"2013-10-22 18:00:04","Jammy","hmmm, looks like it only does 16Gb/s at the moment"
"2013-10-22 18:00:07","Jammy","not that fast"
"2013-10-22 18:00:56","angusp","Jammy: I think you just combine multiple channels for more speed. It's 16 Gb/s for 1 optical fibre"
"2013-10-22 18:00:57","hamhut","the ones of the coast of Africa do about 40Tb/s per fibre"
"2013-10-22 18:01:07","hamhut","off*"
"2013-10-22 18:01:27","hamhut","and you can use one fibre for multiple signals"
"2013-10-22 18:01:59","angusp","hamhut: That's some multiplexing. Almost as good as my 3 exabit ber second download yesterday :p"
"2013-10-22 18:02:30","Jammy","angusp: I don't think you're talking fibre channel here :P"
"2013-10-22 18:02:30","hamhut","angusp: yeah, the best I've seen is a 40Tb flash drive"
"2013-10-22 18:02:37","Jammy","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_channel"

"2013-10-22 18:04:07","Jammy","you're more likely to be using something like SONET for long distance things"
"2013-10-22 18:04:20","Jammy","fibre channel seems to be mostly for SAN and studd"
"2013-10-22 18:04:22","Jammy","stuff*"
"2013-10-22 18:04:33","angusp","I think the thing I'm thinking of is fibre channel... Usually for large ass inter-building intranets"
"2013-10-22 18:05:07","angusp","Jammy: SCSI over fibre channel is cool..."
"2013-10-22 18:09:16","Jammy","also, do inter-building links really use fibre channel?"
"2013-10-22 18:09:19","Jammy","I never realised"
"2013-10-22 18:09:33","Jammy","what's the reason for doing that over just ethernet?"
"2013-10-22 18:09:59","angusp","Where I worked for a bit we had fibre optic stuff going from the servers to the switches in the 5 or so different buildings"
"2013-10-22 18:10:21","angusp","Copper cabling is more expensive, drops voltage and is slower"
"2013-10-22 18:10:41","Jammy","fibre != fibre channel"
"2013-10-22 18:11:16","Jammy","are you sure they weren't using ethernet over fibre?"
"2013-10-22 18:11:39","angusp","Jammy: Never did much with the fibre stuff. I guessed fibre channel was just one protocol for it."
"2013-10-22 18:12:17","Jammy","I guess this is kinda answering my question about if I should learn about this or not :P"
"2013-10-22 18:12:40","Jammy","picking up service provider routing should be relatively simple on my own"
"2013-10-22 18:12:43","Jammy","but this stuff?"
"2013-10-22 18:12:46","angusp","the fibre stuff at work went through some proprietary Ethernet -> Fibre converters, no idea what protocol it uses"
"2013-10-22 18:13:07","angusp","Jammy: All the lower level (TCP...) internet stuff is awesome"
"2013-10-22 18:14:19","Jammy","pffft"
"2013-10-22 18:14:32","angusp","want to try and get unique IPs for all the stuff on my router in my room as it's NATing at the moment. May be hard."
"2013-10-22 18:14:36","Jammy","TCP isn't lower level internet!"
"2013-10-22 18:15:14","Jammy","and you mean publically routable unique IPs?"
"2013-10-22 18:15:29","Jammy","your best bet would be to switch to a business broadband provider"
"2013-10-22 18:15:37","Jammy","or someone like A&A"
"2013-10-22 18:16:13","Jammy","when Be got absorbed into o2, the major providers offering multiple IPv4s seemed to disappear"
"2013-10-22 18:16:51","angusp","Jammy: TCP... Minor brain fart. ARP is low level. TCP is lower than application layer though..."
"2013-10-22 18:17:41","angusp","And the router is on KeyCom, just it's annoying trying to run servers on multiple machines without setting porr forwarding."
"2013-10-22 18:17:49","angusp","port*"
"2013-10-22 18:19:06","Jammy","man, do Keycom even give each room a single IP still?"
"2013-10-22 18:19:21","Jammy","I honestly thought they'd have sold all of their IP addresses except 5 by now"
"2013-10-22 18:19:33","angusp","No idea. Probably NATting like crazy"
"2013-10-22 18:19:55","angusp","can't be bothered to check packets to see how badly"
"2013-10-22 18:20:00","hamhut","Jammy: I have a unique ip"
"2013-10-22 18:20:19","angusp","hamhut: Nah, that's just what they're telling you :p"
"2013-10-22 18:20:32","Jammy","yeah, are you *sure* about that? :P"
"2013-10-22 18:20:55","hamhut","angusp: fine, it's dynamically assigned, but at least I have one and am not hidden behind a proxy"
"2013-10-22 18:21:11","hamhut","I've had the same ip now for about 3 weeks"
"2013-10-22 18:21:35","hamhut","just checked"
"2013-10-22 18:22:30","angusp","I have a static but it's for the router. I hate how most ISPs are fussy about static IPs"
"2013-10-22 18:23:01","Jammy","can we pls just give up on IPv4 already?"
"2013-10-22 18:23:05","Jammy","IT'S DEAD"
"2013-10-22 18:23:07","Jammy","LET IT DIE"
"2013-10-22 18:23:23","Sunstrike","My ISP refuse to upgrade >.>"
"2013-10-22 18:23:37","angusp","Yeah, but :::0:18:fe:1a:0 doesn't have the same ring to it as 22.212.16.4"
"2013-10-22 18:23:51","angusp","(disclaimer: just made both of those up)"
"2013-10-22 18:24:06","Sunstrike","But there is no place like ::1"
"2013-10-22 18:24:12","StrawHatter","no but, they both sound kyute"
"2013-10-22 18:24:39","angusp","now ::1 is much better than typing 127.0.0.1"
"2013-10-22 18:25:11","Sunstrike","That ::1 shortcut is awesome for trolling idiots in Minecraft streams. They all know "127.0.0.1" by now; none of them know ::1."
"2013-10-22 18:26:12","angusp","NAT is'nt exactly an elegant hack, and you can't expect most people to be able to change to ipv6 easily, so it's the ISPs responsibility"
"2013-10-22 18:26:44","Jammy","angusp: your example IPv6 address would be invalid :P"
"2013-10-22 18:27:16","angusp","Jammy: Most likeley :D"
"2013-10-22 18:28:14","hamhut","fail"
"2013-10-22 18:28:23","Jammy","but yeah, the idea is that you'd just use DNS for everything"
"2013-10-22 18:28:49","angusp","Jammy: It'd be a bit hard to exchange IPs at a big lan party otherwise"
"2013-10-22 18:29:14","Jammy","use neighbour discovery!"
"2013-10-22 18:29:47","Jammy","exchanging IPs at LANs is so 1990"
"2013-10-22 18:30:15","Jammy","so is manually configuring your IP address or using DHCP"
"2013-10-22 18:30:21","Jammy","SLAAC is where it's at"
"2013-10-22 18:30:36","hamhut","do expand"
"2013-10-22 18:30:55","angusp","what were we even playong over lan in 1990? (I say we, but mean old people because I was -4)"
"2013-10-22 18:31:16","hamhut","zork!"
"2013-10-22 18:31:16","angusp","hamhut: d  o    e  x  p  a  n  d"

"2013-10-22 18:31:53","angusp","ha ha"
"2013-10-22 18:32:21","Jammy","hamhut: expand on the SLAAC thing?"
"2013-10-22 18:32:55","StrawHatter","angusp, did you really just say you were -4?"
"2013-10-22 18:33:02","hamhut","Jammy: yeah, is it a new protocol?"
"2013-10-22 18:33:09","Jammy","SLAAC is really fucking cool"
"2013-10-22 18:33:14","Jammy","it's part of IPv6"
"2013-10-22 18:33:24","angusp","StrawHatter: in 1990, yes"
"2013-10-22 18:33:35","Jammy","so basically"
"2013-10-22 18:33:39","hamhut","is it serverless?"
"2013-10-22 18:34:31","Jammy","every IPv6 enabled interface has a link local address"
"2013-10-22 18:34:40","Jammy","you can see yours right now, you almost definitely have them"
"2013-10-22 18:35:21","Jammy","these are local to a link, so when you first connect, you assign yourself a link local address and then broadcast something like "YO! ANY ROUTERS IN THE HOUSE?""
"2013-10-22 18:36:44","StrawHatter","guise"
"2013-10-22 18:36:51","StrawHatter","what's an STMU?"
"2013-10-22 18:36:56","hamhut","oh, cool, I see my local link with ifconfig..."
"2013-10-22 18:36:57","angusp","And all the routers be like: YO! SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY USING IPV6! HELP!"
"2013-10-22 18:38:00","Jammy","routers receiving this respond with "YO! I'M A ROUTER! I AM 2001:470::abcd:efab:cdef AND YOU LIVE IN 2001:470::/64"

"2013-10-22 18:38:35","hamhut","Jammp: sounds good, what are the chances of conflicting ipv6? (not statistically, but are they assigned like MAC addresses?)"
"2013-10-22 18:38:57","Jammy","or, put in full, 2001:0470:0000:0000"
"2013-10-22 18:39:16","Jammy","the bottom half of the address is then derived from the MAC address of the interface"
"2013-10-22 18:39:28","angusp","Are the IPv6 and IPv4 spaces completely isolated from eachother on the same router? is there any crossover?"
"2013-10-22 18:39:57","Jammy","completely isolated"

"2013-10-22 18:40:52","Jammy","EUI-64 (the thing used to work out the bottom half of the address in SLAAC) needs a /64"

"2013-10-22 18:41:33","Jammy","for that IPv6 subnetting goodness"
"2013-10-22 18:41:46","Jammy","seeing as subnets can't be smaller than /64"
"2013-10-22 18:44:39","StrawHatter","phew, i can come along on friday <3"
"2013-10-22 18:44:51","hamhut","StrawHatter: for the egm?"

"2013-10-27 23:40:30","ball-hayden","We need people"
"2013-10-27 23:40:35","ball-hayden","And kit."
"2013-10-27 23:40:37","ball-hayden","But mostly people"

"2013-10-27 23:50:00","hamhut","Toby Bailey, he's not too bad."
"2013-10-27 23:50:08","hamhut","actually, he's good"
"2013-10-27 23:50:16","angusp","hamhut: But not as cool as Don"
"2013-10-27 23:50:22","KitB","I certainly found linear algebra tricky"
"2013-10-27 23:50:44","KitB","Just make sure you can multiply matrices and you'll pretty much be fine"
"2013-10-27 23:50:50","KitB","Not necessarily for the course"
"2013-10-27 23:51:02","KitB","But for the rest of the courses you rarely need more than matrix multiplication"

"2013-10-28 11:03:56","angusp","Yeah, when you look at it fsm are really simple"

"2013-10-28 11:04:23","Sunstrike","Meh. Anyway. I'm flicking through the slides. It's actually pretty cool"
"2013-10-28 11:04:48","angusp","Yeah. I don't know how long he's been lecturing but I kinda get the impression that he's quite nervous about it"
"2013-10-28 11:05:34","StrawHatter","I'm sure that this is his first time lecturing CL. This is what I've heard anyway."
"2013-10-28 11:06:15","KitB","It is"
"2013-10-28 11:07:18","StrawHatter","Maybe he just isn't used to lecturing yet? I mean, you can tell he knows his stuff.. But he can't really explain it very well.."
"2013-10-28 11:07:37","Sunstrike","Yeah, that's what I think it is"
"2013-10-28 11:07:46","Sunstrike","But he only ends up confusing me more, so I self-teach it"

"2013-10-28 11:08:40","StrawHatter","I kinda do the opposite"
"2013-10-28 11:08:48","angusp","Yeah, CL tutorials are great. Usually just ask about any outstanding issues and Areti (my tutor) goes over them fine."
"2013-10-28 11:08:52","Sunstrike","I find the tutorials infinitely more useful"

"2013-10-28 11:09:28","StrawHatter","I tried to go to mine last Wednesday. But I forgot what room it was and I had a mini-panic attack so I just kinda didn't go"

"2013-10-28 11:11:08","Sunstrike","Yeah. It's also quite slow because some tutors insist on doing all the writing. But my tutor is pretty good about it despite that; goes through and explains how the program flows"

"2013-10-28 14:07:46","KitB","Also sort of"
"2013-10-28 14:08:02","KitB","It can be used in that way"
"2013-10-28 14:08:07","KitB","but it is also more than that"
"2013-10-28 14:08:18","KitB","With Case you can perform pattern matching"

"2013-10-28 14:21:02","StrawHatter","Haskell sure is a tricky customer"
"2013-10-28 14:21:09","KitB","There's guards which are more like conditionals"
"2013-10-28 14:21:22","KitB","But you can implement a case using just conditionals"
"2013-10-28 14:21:36","KitB","(like in Python, where there is no case or switch statement)"
"2013-10-28 14:21:37","StrawHatter","That's mainly what I use Case for, HUGE big, if then else trees"
"2013-10-28 14:22:03","KitB","and in Haskell we use guards for such things"
"2013-10-28 14:22:38","KitB","The concept of multiple equations for a single function is how we do cases"
"2013-10-28 14:22:51","KitB","so you can do:"
"2013-10-28 14:22:58","KitB","f 1 = 1"
"2013-10-28 14:23:05","KitB","f 2 = 1"

"2013-10-30 08:22:24","Jammy","I'm always up this early"

"2013-10-30 08:27:06","Jammy","it's difficult to keep track of how many years you spend in that hell hole"
"2013-10-30 08:27:14","Jammy","I think it was 4"
"2013-10-30 08:32:58","hamhut","srsly? why did you drop out? other than not liking it... or another more specific question, why is it a hell hole?"
"2013-10-30 08:33:55","Jammy","I didn't drop out :P"
"2013-10-30 08:34:15","hamhut","oh :p"
"2013-10-30 08:34:34","hamhut","I was led to beliove you had="
"2013-10-30 08:35:40","Jammy","and it's a hell hole because by the end of it, you're spending 16 hours a day working on problems that have already been solved, learning quite a bit of irrelevant stuff and not being paid for it, or in some cases, paying for the priveledge"
"2013-10-30 08:37:18","hamhut","fair nuff, but was the work at least interesting?"
"2013-10-30 08:37:39","hamhut","and what did you do for your final project?"
"2013-10-30 08:45:19","StrawHatter","/joined"
"2013-10-30 08:46:00","Jammy","some was interesting, but some of it you're just doing because you need some more credits"
"2013-10-30 08:46:19","Jammy","and my final project was a computer vision one"
"2013-10-30 08:49:19","Jammy","the computer looks at things and goes "I CAN SIT ON THAT""
"2013-10-30 08:49:29","Jammy","and then it animates a little man sitting on it"

"2013-10-30 09:32:21","StrawHatter","Oohh"
"2013-10-30 09:32:37","StrawHatter","That's pretty cool"
"2013-10-30 09:34:59","Jammy","would have been if it didn't suck"
"2013-10-30 09:35:05","Jammy","it was my worst mark ever"
"2013-10-30 09:36:17","StrawHatter","oh"
"2013-10-30 09:36:19","StrawHatter","derp"
"2013-10-30 09:36:30","StrawHatter","was this for 4th year?"
"2013-10-30 09:43:36","Jammy","yup!"
"2013-10-30 09:43:47","Jammy","I like to think it was partly due to lack of motivation"
"2013-10-30 09:44:28","Jammy","it's hard to convince yourself that putting a lot of work in all year is worth it when you've got a job offer already"
"2013-10-30 09:45:32","StrawHatter","so true so true"
"2013-10-30 09:45:41","KitB","It's getting somewhat hard to be motivated even without a job offer"
"2013-10-30 09:45:54","KitB","during my 5th year of this degree"
"2013-10-30 09:47:09","KitB","though not for my project"
"2013-10-30 09:47:17","KitB","That's fairly easy to motivate myself to do"
"2013-10-30 09:47:23","KitB","because it's fun"
"2013-10-30 09:47:29","KitB","and worth half of my total marks this year"
"2013-10-30 09:48:05","StrawHatter","is it true that like 90% of your actual mark comes from work in 4th year?"
"2013-10-30 09:49:23","Jammy","what do you mean by work?"
"2013-10-30 09:49:31","Jammy","all of your marks come from work in every year"
"2013-10-30 09:49:49","Jammy","we don't do those credits for attending a meeting with your personal tutor and stuff that some other unis do"
"2013-10-30 09:50:25","StrawHatter","ugh"
"2013-10-30 09:50:56","Jammy","still disappointed that the uni didn't accept my credits from Helsinki for doing things like attending orientation or completing my study plan or drinking"
"2013-10-30 09:51:06","StrawHatter","does that mean that first year actually maters?"
"2013-10-30 09:51:18","Jammy","I think I actually came back with 70 credits, rather than the 60 I needed"
"2013-10-30 09:51:24","Jammy","and no, it doesn't"
"2013-10-30 09:51:31","Jammy","well, as long as you pass"
"2013-10-30 09:51:56","Jammy","second year there's some requirement I can't remember to do with getting 50% in some amount of informatics courses or you can't go in to 4th year"
"2013-10-30 09:52:07","Jammy","3rd and 4th year actually count towards your degree"
"2013-10-30 09:52:12","StrawHatter","oh phew"
"2013-10-30 09:52:19","Jammy","unless you go away for 3rd year"
"2013-10-30 09:52:27","Jammy","in which case, everything is on 4th year"
"2013-10-30 09:52:45","Jammy","and first year really shouldn't be a problem for you anyway"
"2013-10-30 09:53:06","Jammy","like, if you're struggling now, you really need to try and sort that ASAP"
"2013-10-30 09:53:19","Jammy","because the difficulty ramps up a lot very quickly after that"
"2013-10-30 09:53:35","StrawHatter","it's not so much sturggling, it's a lack of wanting to work"
"2013-10-30 09:53:59","Jammy","well that's kind of struggling"
"2013-10-30 09:54:03","Jammy","or at least, it depends"
"2013-10-30 09:54:20","Jammy","I didn't do much work in first year, and still almost aced it"
"2013-10-30 09:54:43","Jammy","but if not doing much work means that you do badly in first year, I think it's time somebody tells you that years tends to follow on from eachother"
"2013-10-30 09:55:02","Jammy","your marks may not count this year, but if you don't already know the stuff that's being taught, you're going to have a bad time in second year"
"2013-10-30 09:55:27","Jammy","and if you have a bad time in second year, you're going to have a bad time in third year and so on"
"2013-10-30 09:55:32","StrawHatter","ow"
"2013-10-30 09:55:48","Jammy","none of this means you're totally screwed, because you *can* usually work hard and catch up"
"2013-10-30 09:55:53","Jammy","at least during the first 2 years"
"2013-10-30 09:56:03","Jammy","after that, you have a pretty high workload anyway"
"2013-10-30 09:56:12","StrawHatter","whelp"
"2013-10-30 09:56:17","Jammy","basically, don't panic"
"2013-10-30 09:56:38","Jammy","and if you know everything you're being taught this year, by all means just party and don't work"
"2013-10-30 09:56:59","Jammy","but if you're not working AND you don't know everything, then it's probably time you start turning up to tutorials"
"2013-10-30 09:58:16","StrawHatter","i"
"2013-10-30 09:58:22","StrawHatter","should probably start working then like omg"
"2013-10-30 10:00:23","StrawHatter","oh"
"2013-10-30 10:00:48","StrawHatter","This"
"2013-10-30 10:00:53","StrawHatter","Might actually be catach-upable"
"2013-10-30 10:01:41","Jammy","that's exacly what I just said :P"
"2013-10-30 10:02:10","Jammy","in first year, if you're doing everything you should, you're probably working for like... 24 hours a week?"
"2013-10-30 10:02:24","Jammy","which leaves a hell of a lot of time for catching up on the first half of the semester"
"2013-10-30 10:02:47","StrawHatter","24 hours?!"
"2013-10-30 10:04:07","StrawHatter","That's... Actually not as much as I thought at first glance"
"2013-10-30 10:04:31","Jammy","oh good god"
"2013-10-30 10:04:54","Jammy","if that sounds worrying to you, you need to reevaluate your idea of work"
"2013-10-30 10:05:53","Jammy","let's put it this way"
"2013-10-30 10:06:05","StrawHatter","I'm extremely lazy about doing things that don't interest me much"
"2013-10-30 10:06:07","Jammy","at the 3rd/4th year level, 10 credits should take 100 hours of work"
"2013-10-30 10:06:14","Jammy","you do 60 credits a semester"
"2013-10-30 10:06:20","Jammy","so 600 hours per semester"
"2013-10-30 10:06:31","Jammy","which is... 11 weeks long?"
"2013-10-30 10:06:38","Jammy","so like... just over 54 hours a week"
"2013-10-30 10:06:43","StrawHatter","Fudge"
"2013-10-30 10:06:51","StrawHatter","I thought semesters were 12 weeks"
"2013-10-30 10:06:56","Jammy","and some courses take more than 100 hours"
"2013-10-30 10:07:12","Jammy","oh yeah, they extended them, didn't they"
"2013-10-30 10:07:18","StrawHatter","ohthankgoodness"
"2013-10-30 10:07:23","Jammy","innovative learning week"
"2013-10-30 10:07:41","Jammy","also, I don't know why you're ohthankgoodnessing"
"2013-10-30 10:07:44","Jammy","guess what"
"2013-10-30 10:07:48","StrawHatter","hwat"
"2013-10-30 10:08:03","Jammy","if you have an extra week, your lecturers know you have an extra week, and the course gets bigger"
"2013-10-30 10:08:08","Jammy","probably by like 2 weeks worth of work"
"2013-10-30 10:08:14","StrawHatter","...."
"2013-10-30 10:08:15","Jammy","because 1 extra week is useless"

"2013-10-30 10:23:20","KitB","Well I'll be having a meeting with Ian later today"
"2013-10-30 10:23:43","KitB","and Brian usually has a meeting with Ian just before mine"
"2013-10-30 10:23:55","StrawHatter","that reminds me, do all people in 4/5th years get offices?"
"2013-10-30 10:23:55","KitB","(this year, at least)"
"2013-10-30 10:23:59","KitB","Hell no"
"2013-10-30 10:24:03","Jammy","lololol"
"2013-10-30 10:24:09","Jammy","I like to put a desk in the elevator"
"2013-10-30 10:24:15","KitB","only PhD students get offices to my knowledge"
"2013-10-30 10:24:28","KitB","and they're running out of space for them"
"2013-10-30 10:25:50","KitB","There was talk last year of getting a MInf5 working room"
"2013-10-30 10:26:12","KitB","But again there's not enough space"
"2013-10-30 10:27:28","Jammy","maybe we should get rid of offices entirely and just use the cutting edge Cisco WebEx technology to collaborate from wherever we may be"
"2013-10-30 10:27:40","Jammy","I am the lord of remote work said he"
"2013-10-30 10:27:48","KitB","We could totally use Hangouts"

"2013-10-30 10:28:46","Jammy","can you click a raise hand button?"

"2013-10-30 10:28:55","KitB","But you can raise your hand"
"2013-10-30 10:29:12","Jammy","what if you are collaborating with many many people and cannot see them all on video?"
"2013-10-30 10:29:23","KitB","Then they speak up"
"2013-10-30 10:29:25","Jammy","how do you signal that you have a question without interrupting then?"
"2013-10-30 10:29:39","KitB","I can see the utility of such a function"
"2013-10-30 10:29:53","KitB","But Hangouts is free"
"2013-10-30 10:29:58","Jammy","and you can't be like "Who has the ball? Errrrr.... ok, I've got the ball now""
"2013-10-30 10:30:39","Jammy","we had hilarious audio problems with hangouts at FreeAgent"

"2013-10-30 11:13:22","KitB","Which tutorial are you doing?"
"2013-10-30 11:13:46","StrawHatter","Numero Uno"
"2013-10-30 11:14:17","KitB","splendid"
"2013-10-30 11:14:33","KitB","If you start finding the optional material too hard later on"
"2013-10-30 11:14:35","KitB","don't worry"
"2013-10-30 11:14:36","StrawHatter","Gotta start at number 1 and work upwards right? </3"
"2013-10-30 11:14:50","KitB","The optional material is often much harder than the exam"
"2013-10-30 11:15:03","StrawHatter","I had a quick glance at the stuff for tutorial 5"
"2013-10-30 11:15:08","StrawHatter","It doesn't look very pretty"
"2013-10-30 11:15:15","darius","/left"
"2013-10-30 11:15:29","Jammy","I just remember finding $ confusing and pretty much avoiding it"
"2013-10-30 11:17:06","hamhut","$ is pretty awesome, It allows the use of less brackets"
"2013-10-30 11:17:26","KitB","Don't forget mapping values over functions, padawan"
"2013-10-30 11:17:29","hamhut","I'm a little scared of pointless style,"
"2013-10-30 11:18:20","hamhut","haven't done that yet, but this weeks tutorial is quite interesting, think I'm gonna have to open my book :("
"2013-10-30 11:18:31","KitB","Oh you won't ever have to"
"2013-10-30 11:18:36","StrawHatter","question, in the exam, will they give us the Data Flow?"
"2013-10-30 11:18:49","StrawHatter","Like, [String] -> [String] ?"
"2013-10-30 11:18:53","KitB","But it's an example of how ($) is more than just a replacement for parentheses"
"2013-10-30 11:19:15","KitB","StrawHatter: Unless there's a question that explicitly asks you to give the type of something"
"2013-10-30 11:19:34","KitB","You shouldn't think of it as Data Flow"
"2013-10-30 11:20:08","KitB","a function of a -> b -> c doesn't take an 'a', turn it into a 'b', then turn that into a 'c'"
"2013-10-30 11:20:12","StrawHatter","But but but, it's the flow of data... kinda... not really but still!"
"2013-10-30 11:20:24","KitB","it takes an 'a' and a 'b' and turns them into a 'c'"
"2013-10-30 11:20:45","Jammy","it's just a retarded syntax for all of the types going into or out of a function"
"2013-10-30 11:20:54","Jammy","why they chose -> I will never understand"
"2013-10-30 11:20:55","KitB","It's a small distinction but one that might help you later on ;)"
"2013-10-30 11:20:59","Jammy","it is very misleading"
"2013-10-30 11:21:05","KitB","Because currying"
"2013-10-30 11:21:42","StrawHatter","wait so, in the exam, do we get the "a -> b -> c" thingy?"
"2013-10-30 11:21:43","KitB","f :: a -> b -> c == f :: a -> (b -> c)"
"2013-10-30 11:22:20","KitB","StrawHatter: The exam will be a lot like the tutorial exercises"
"2013-10-30 11:22:35","StrawHatter","oh.. I'm kinda cool with that"
"2013-10-30 11:22:58","KitB","If you can do the first five or so tutorial exercises you'll do fine on the exam"
"2013-10-30 11:23:08","KitB","Unless they significantly change the content of the exam"
"2013-10-30 11:23:12","KitB","Which I doubt they will do"
"2013-10-30 11:24:31","StrawHatter","I'm guessing we won't get it in a cute .pdf file though..."
"2013-10-30 11:24:48","KitB","Actually I'm pretty sure it will be available on the machine as a PDF"
"2013-10-30 11:25:18","Jammy","yeah, I seem to remember it was too"
"2013-10-30 11:25:31","KitB","I mean the sheets on the desks will just be printed from a PDF like the tutorial ones"
"2013-10-30 11:26:46","StrawHatter","oh my gosh, yes! <333"
"2013-10-30 11:28:34","KitB","If you want to make things that look exactly like the tutorials you could look into LaTeX"
"2013-10-30 11:28:45","KitB","But I would concentrate on other things right now if I were you"
"2013-10-30 11:29:24","StrawHatter","haha yeah"
"2013-10-30 11:37:55","angusp","Anyone here?"
"2013-10-30 11:38:13","KitB","many people"

"2013-10-30 11:41:06","StrawHatter","angusp: ARM talk?"
"2013-10-30 11:43:08","angusp","StrawHatter: There's a talk on 30 mins after ILA from the ARM processor people"
"2013-10-30 11:44:06","StrawHatter","Ohhh, probably not since I'll still probably be catching up :P"

"2013-11-04 11:32:41","KitB","I wouldn't call C verbose either"
"2013-11-04 11:32:51","Sunstrike","C is low-level compared to Java so you need more "stuff" to get somewhere"
"2013-11-04 11:33:00","KitB","Not necessarily"
"2013-11-04 11:33:06","KitB","See previous comment about boilerplate"
"2013-11-04 11:33:17","Sunstrike","Well, you need to map memory and such. It's not -verbose- as such, just technical"
"2013-11-04 11:33:18","StrawHatter","ohhh"
"2013-11-04 11:33:36","Sunstrike","I wouldn't recommend C as a starting language :P"

"2013-11-08 14:02:34","hamhut","what do we have now?"
"2013-11-08 14:02:44","oliland","Jammy: do you write integration tests for network services? or do you make mock servers and unit test them"
"2013-11-08 14:03:18","Jammy","Hmmmm"
"2013-11-08 14:04:04","Jammy","My personal opinion is to write tests against the actual service, rather then mocking servers"
"2013-11-08 14:04:09","aegis","/joined"
"2013-11-08 14:04:15","Jammy","Well, if the service is outside your control at least"
"2013-11-08 14:04:57","Jammy","The argument against doing that seems to be that either 1) Your network connection being down causes failures or 2) The service changing causes failures"
"2013-11-08 14:05:13","Jammy","But for 1) If you know it's down, don't run the tests"
"2013-11-08 14:05:35","Jammy","and 2) If the service changes in a way that your tests break, it's probably breaking your code too, so you want to know about it"
"2013-11-08 14:05:40","oliland","the main argument i've seen against it is that unit tests are supposed to be part of the build process, and happen as quickly as possible"
"2013-11-08 14:05:53","oliland","so integration tests should really be part of a seperate suite?"
"2013-11-08 14:06:06","oliland","i need an adult :("
"2013-11-08 14:06:23","Jammy","well do what you think is best!"
"2013-11-08 14:06:39","Jammy","ultimately, you should be doing *something* that tests against the actual service before shipping"
"2013-11-08 14:06:41","aegis","what's the discussion about?"
"2013-11-08 14:06:50","Jammy","so probably either write both"
"2013-11-08 14:06:54","Jammy","or skip the unit tests"
"2013-11-08 14:07:03","Jammy","or skip the integration tests and do a manual test before shipping"
"2013-11-08 14:07:13","oliland","aegis: whether to write integration tests to test network code or write unit tests with stubbed servers"
"2013-11-08 14:07:24","Jammy","whichever you feel more comfortable with I guess"
"2013-11-08 14:07:54","Jammy","the unit tests with a stubbed server can also be good for if the server spec changes"
"2013-11-08 14:08:40","oliland","yeah i guess as you can see what's broken"
"2013-11-08 14:08:46","aegis","oliland: oh. not sure but I guess a combination of both would be good; unit & stubbed server to make sure your code behave as expected and integration testing to check if your stubbed server behave the same way as the actual server"
"2013-11-08 14:08:51","Jammy","because then you can change the stubbed server to match the reality and update the app to make the test pass without needing to hit the actual service"

"2013-11-08 14:12:09","Jammy","there are definitely wrong answers (i.e. not testing at all)"

"2013-11-09 16:55:40","angusp","Sunstrike: Erm, no idea. Check."
"2013-11-09 16:55:59","angusp","As a compute server you'd have thought it has every language under the sun"

"2013-11-09 16:59:30","Sunstrike","Good news is it's DB can't inflate much - It just increments values in a SQLite3 table"

"2013-11-09 17:03:43","@amazoph","ruby2 is only available as a package in unstable"

"2013-11-09 17:15:01","ball-hayden","Use RVM"
"2013-11-09 17:16:21","ball-hayden","It's much easier - we could easily set up a multi-user install of that on something."
